DevOps practices at scale reveal key patterns. Worth understanding.

Unpopular opinion: Platform Engineering isn't just a rebrand of DevOps - it's a fundamental shift in how we think about developer experience.

Key insights on why platform engineering will replace traditional devops:

• Define the core difference between DevOps and Platform Engineering
• Share real examples of platform teams succeeding
• Address common misconceptions
• Provide actionable insights

What's your take? Is Platform Engineering the future or just hype?

⚡ 💭 Perspective shift on a common practice.
Cloud-native systems and Kubernetes updates reveal trends. Let's break this down.

🎯 Platform engineering is just good product management applied to internal tools. Nothing revolutionary.

My reasoning:
→ I've seen this pattern across multiple orgs
→ The industry hype often doesn't match ground reality
→ Simple solutions usually outperform complex ones

What's the counter-argument?
